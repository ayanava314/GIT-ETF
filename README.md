# Geometric Invariant Theory & Equiangular Tight Frames (ETF) : 2025 Reading Course
A collaborative reading course exploring the mathematical foundations of Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT) and Equiangular Tight Frames. This repository contains weekly summaries, lecture notes, and discussion materials.

**📍 Public Website:** [https://ayanava314.github.io/GIT-ETF/](https://ayanava314.github.io/GIT-ETF/)

## About This Course

This reading course covers:
- **Geometric Invariant Theory**: Classical invariant theory through the lens of algebraic geometry (following Dolgachev's *Lectures on Invariant Theory*)
- **Equiangular Tight Frames**: Applications of GIT to Finite Equiangular Tight Frames

## 🚀 Quick Start

### View the Course Online
Visit the [published website](https://ayanava314.github.io/GIT-ETF/) to browse weekly summaries and download full notes.

### Contribute or Modify Content
Sign in to GitHub to modify content/make suggestions/comment on pages. Will post a simple clone to push walkthrough later if needed.

## 📚 Using These Materials

### Weekly Format
Each week includes:
- **Summary page** (`weekNN.md`): Key concepts, readings, and learning objectives
- **Detailed notes** (`notes/weekNNtex`): Formal definitions, theorems, proofs
- **Discussion thread**: Use GitHub Issues/Discussions tab to ask questions

### Labels for Issues/Discussions
- `question`: Mathematical questions or clarifications
- `typo`: Errors in notes or summaries
- `discussion`: General discussion or alternative approaches
- `reading`: Recommendations for additional resources

## 📖 Recommended Readings

- **Dolgachev**: *Lectures on Invariant Theory* (primary reference)
- **Mumford, Fogarty, Kirwan**: *Geometric Invariant Theory* (classical reference)
- **Waldron**: *An Introduction to Finite Tight Frames* (comprehensive ETF treatment)
- *Equiangular Tight Frames* research papers (linked in weekly content)

## 🛠 Technical Notes

- **Math Rendering**: MathJax 3.2.2 renders all LaTeX math in browser
- **Site Theme**: Customized Cayman theme with green gradient header. Planning to experiment/change later.
- **Deployment**: Automatic via GitHub Pages on every push to `main`
- **Source Format**: Markdown (Jekyll) for web + LaTeX for detailed notes
